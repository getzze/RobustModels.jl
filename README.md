# Robust linear models in Julia

This package defines robust linear models (`RobustLinearModel`) and robust generalized linear models (`RobustGeneralizedLinearModel`). Users can use the abstraction for statistical model API to build, fit (`fit`/`fit!`), and query the fitted models.

A _robust model_ is a statistical model for a _response_ variable as a function of one or more _covariates_.
